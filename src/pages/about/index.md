### Philosophy

üòé I am passionate about software development. I see how the Internet makes human's life a better place - and I want to be part of the solution. I am definitely a competitive person. I do all my best to make my dreams come true. Life is all about challenging and pushing ourselves. My strong motivation has always been driving me toward innovation. My favorite quote is "Stay hungry, stay foolish" - Steve Jobs. I love learning and developing myself, never be afraid of failing because failure is a success yet not fulfilled. That's how I make my life count ‚ù§Ô∏è
