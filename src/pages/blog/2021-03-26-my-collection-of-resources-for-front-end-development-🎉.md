First and foremost, I am a strong believer who has 100% trust on learning by doing. Most of resources out there will only show you tiny example of how their technology works in standalone mode without showing how they fit into the big picture. Let's say you want to build a personal blog, you mostly need a front-end UI frameworks, CSS styling, static hosting process, etc. We typically need to answer these [three questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA):

1. Why do you want to build it, aka what kind of problems your solution is trying to solve?
2. What do you need to do to make it happens?
3. How do you about to do it?

I have done several personal projects before actually got into any companies that really require according technologies I used. My very first React application is a [milk tea app](https://delivery-now-milktea.netlify.app/) that let users search and sort for necessary items before sharing to their friends. I learnt several concepts by making this application such as responsive design, component architecture, css layout, deployment hosting, page crawling, server side node.js, mongoDB, etc. This where things started to sync into the back of my brain as they came together and fit into one usable application. As it turns out, my way of learning is really slick and backed by science üòé as I found out about [how human brain works](https://blogs.aspect.com/learning-by-doing-technology-in-the-flipped-classroom/).

Alright guys, that's pretty much what I have for you as my "best" ways for learning and hopefully it will work for you. Here is comes resources for keeping up with fast-pace challenging, exciting and beautiful front-end world.
