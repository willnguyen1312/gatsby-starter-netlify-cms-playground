> Money can't buy happiness ðŸ’ž

It's one of the most famous sayings of all times. I had believed this quote for such a very very long time. Until one day, I watched a TED Talks that totally blew my mind away. Seem like the sentence above is not absolutely correct. "Could money buy happiness" - my answer is **YES** and **NO**. And here is why:

* Without being able to fulfill our basic need according to [Maslow](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) model, we would never be happy. Hence, we definitely need money
* Money itself can't buy you happiness. The **WAY** you use it **DOES**
* Happiness comes from every little things that most of us have forget since we become adult. Things like have a small talk to stranger, go to the beach, playing games, go for a walk with your dog, etc

Just a brief explanation of why we all need money and definitely a money management system. I strongly believed there should never be a solution so-called "one size fit all". So, I took my initiative from one of the most famous budget management system out there - [YNAB ](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). Instead of calling it YNAB, I call it INAB to solve my own problems and use this chance to build something that could serve someone else as a foundation in their upcoming projects

Regarding to my project, I decided to take the mono repo approach in order to leverage the ecosystem around [Apollographql](https://www.apollographql.com/). The codebase consists of three packages thanks to awesome tool so-called [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/):

* Common - code share between server and client
* Web - front-end React application
* Server - apollo server application

Enjoy guys, please feel free to fork the repo. I'm open up to all ideas and suggestions. Peace out ðŸ˜Š
