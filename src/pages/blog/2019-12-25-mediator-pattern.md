title: Mediator Pattern

description: >-
  Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator
  promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other
  explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently

### Applicability

* A set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured and difficult to understand
* Reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
* A behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing

[\#DesignPatterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

Let's code up a sample application in which it has several renderers and a mediator controls the rendering processing as there is only one renderer allowed to work at a time. First of all, the interfaces for Renderer and Mediator

Next, we would want to implement couple of renderers like below

And finally the implementation of mediator that notify and control how these renderer works in harmony

And voila, we have the implementation of Mediator Pattern in Go. This pattern helps to mitigate the couple of components when working together in a complex system. The prominent example would be forms, airport, harbor, et cetera
