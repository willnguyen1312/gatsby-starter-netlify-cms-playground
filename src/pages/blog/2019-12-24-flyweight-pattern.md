### Applicability

* An application uses a large number of objects
* Storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects
* Most object state can be made extrinsic
* Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed.
* The application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct objects.

[\#DesignPatterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

Let's put the definition above into practice. We have a list of three library that will be used differently at run time, the libraries' state can be made extrinsically  such as name and ID. There is no need to re-create these fields all over again to save memory footprint. We would need a factory and cache pool to alleviate that. First up, we want to have a library structure as below

Then, we want to define a function that create different initial library state like below

Last but not least, we need to implement a Library factory that contain the cache that store already created library and couple of utility methods to verify the success of application.

And there we have a complete implementation of Flyweight Pattern in Go. With this library, memory can be saved a ton at scale in tradeoff a more complexity added to the codebase. Hence, this pattern should be used with caution
