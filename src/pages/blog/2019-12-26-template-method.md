description: >-
  Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to
  subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an
  algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure

### Applicability

* To implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and leave it up to subclasses to implement the behavior that can vary
* When common behavior among subclasses should be factored and localized in a common class to avoid code duplication

[\#DesignPatterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

Let's put this pattern into practice. We are going to implement a simple pizza maker application. We have a template that define a separate steps to perform action from the beginning to an end. Any cooker should implement that to be usable code. First, we need a template interface like so

Next we would need to make couple of implementation of the interface above

And final is the consumer code that make use of this template method

And there we have it - the complete implementation of Template Method Pattern in Go. The real world analogy would be two factors authentication either by sms or email. Both need to generate a unique code, just differ in sender method
